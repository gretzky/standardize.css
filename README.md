# standardize.css

A compilation of [normalize](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css), [standardize](https://github.com/jonathantneal/sanitize.css) and [html5bp](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate), without the opinions and with more accessibility classes.

**npm**

```sh
npm install --save standardize.css
```

## Why this over the others?

All projects are different, and oftentimes I found the opinionated styles would override or influence my custom styles- so I stripped them out. More accessibility classes are included, courtesy of html5bp.

## Browser support

* Chrome (last 2)
* Edge (last 2)
* Firefox (last two)
* Firefox ESR
* IE 10+, Edge
* iOS Safari (last two)
* Opera (last two)
* Safari 8+

Support for outdated browsers has also been removed (mainly IE 8 and 9).

## Shoutout

thanks to [Nicholas Gallagher](https://github.com/necolas), [Jonathan Neal](https://github.com/jonathantneal), and the creators and mainters of [HTML5-Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/) for their research and work in browser-supporting CSS.
